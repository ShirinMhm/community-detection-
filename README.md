# Community Detection

This project implements algorithms for detecting communities in networks. Community detection is a vital area in network science, enabling the identification of clusters or groups within graphs, such as social networks, biological networks, and more.

## Features
- **Custom Algorithms**: Implementation of innovative approaches for community detection.
- **Flexibility**: Modular code that can be adapted to different graph datasets.
- **Visualization**: Outputs visual representations of detected communities.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShirinMhm/community-detection.git
